JavaScript and CSS improves on most sunny days. They add support for features that were previously done by libraries, sometimes even mimicking the API. And sometimes there was a native feature all along that has slipped past many of us. This page aims to provide a collection of things like that. Not a complete reference of everything that you can do, but a list of alternative ways that are sometimes overlooked.

Beware that these examples include code that might be unsupported in some browsers with IE and Safari being the most often victims. Some of the suggestions might be found controversial, but that doesn't mean they should be hidden. Learn all the possibilities and choose according to circumstances.
