# Contributing guidelines

Additions are welcome. Design improvements are welcome. Typo fixes are welcome. Any improvements are welcome.

There are just a few notes.


## Be friendly to frameworks

Whenever referencing other frameworks, portray them in a fair manner, don't try to make them look bad.

## Add it only if it's not a lot harder

There's a nice compilation of snippets at youmightnotneedjquery.com. The main criticism about that project is the complexity - it's sometimes a lot longer and clumsier to do it without jQuery. Some even see these examples are seen as "why you need jQuery".

We would like to avoid such examples. If the common version is one line, do not suggest a vanilla version of 12 lines.


## Useful links section is not a directory for everything

I would like this content to fit my own preferences. I add what I find useful, interesting or important. Or just what I enjoyed.
