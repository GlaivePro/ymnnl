## Add it only if it's not a lot harder

There's a nice compilation of snippets at youmightnotneedjquery.com. The main criticism about that project is the complexity - it's sometimes a lot longer and clumsier to do it without jQuery. Some even see these examples are seen as "why you need jQuery".

We would like to avoid such examples. If the common version is one line, do not suggest a vanilla version of 12 lines.
