<h1>You Might Not Need a Library</h1>

<p>JavaScript and CSS improves on most sunny days. They add support for features that were previously done by libraries, sometimes even mimicking the API. 

And sometimes there was a native feature all along that has slipped past many of us. This page aims to provide a collection of things like that.

<h2>Raw JavaScript can do it</h2>

<h3>AJAX GET</h3>

<section class="comparison">
	<div>
		<h4>jQuery</h4>
		<code>
			$.get('example.com', response => {
				// do something with the response
			})
		</code>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>Vanilla</h4>
		<code>
			fetch('example.com')
				.then(response => {
					// do something with the response
				})
		</code>
	</div>
</section>
